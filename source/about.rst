This slow-paced hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using  `Nextflow DSL2 <https://www.nextflow.io>`_ to achieve reproducibility of data analysis. 


.. _home-page-outline:

Outline
============

The 4-half-day Nextflow course will train participants to build Nextflow pipelines and run them with `Singularity <https://sylabs.io/singularity/>`_ containers.

It is designed to provide trainees with short and frequent hands-on sessions, while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum.

The course will be fully virtual via the `Zoom <https://zoom.us/>`_ platform.

Trainees will work in a dedicated `AWS environment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS/>`_.

Learning objectives
============

* Locate and fetch Docker/Singularity images from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Docker/Singularity container from the command line.
* Locate and fetch Nextflow pipelines from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Nextflow pipeline.
* Describe and explain Nextflow's basic concepts.
* Test and modify a Nextflow pipeline.
* Implement short blocks of code into a Nextflow pipeline.
* Develop a Nextflow pipeline from scratch.
* Run a pipeline in diverse computational environments (local, HPC, cloud).
* Share a pipeline.

.. _home-page-prereq:

Prerequisite / technical requirements
============


Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.
Knowledge of containers is not mandatory; however, this `SIB course <https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20211014_DOCK>`_ can be advised to take. The course materials is online in the dedicated GitHub page for self-learning.

Practitioners will need to connect during the course to a remove server via the "ssh" protocotol. You can learn about it `here <https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work>`_

Those who follow the course should be able to use a command-line/screen-oriented text editor (such as nano or vi/vim, which are already available in the server) or to be able to use an editor able to connect remotely. For sake of information, below the basics of `nano <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Basics_Guide>`_

Having a `GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`_ is recommended.
